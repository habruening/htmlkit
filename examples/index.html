<html><style>pre { background-color : lightgrey;}</style><h1>Basic HTML functions</h1><p>We can create normal HTML nodes with Hiccup.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:p {:style {:background-color "green"}} "Black on Green"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p style="background-color:green;">Black on Green</p></blockquote><hr><p>We can retroactively add more attributes into HTML nodes.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/attributes-into-node
 [:p {:style {:background-color "green"}} "Orange on Green"]
 {:style {:color "orange"}})
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p style="background-color:green;color:orange;">Orange on Green</p></blockquote><hr><p>There is a shortcut for the id attribute.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/add-id
 "node-234"
 [:p {:style {:background-color "green"}} "Black on Green"])
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p id="node-234" style="background-color:green;">Black on Green</p></blockquote><h1>Integrating JavaScript Code</h1><p>JavaScript can be integrated in two ways. The function js/js takes an expression in the Clojure syntax for JavaScript and renders it into a string that can be used in Hiccup. The expression must be quoted. Otherwise it would be evaluated before passed to js/js. The convenience macro js/jsq does the same, but does not require the expression to be quoted.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:button {:onClick (js/jsq (alert "clicked"))} "click me"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><button onClick="alert(&apos;clicked&apos;)">click me</button></blockquote><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:button {:onClick (js/js '(alert "clicked"))} "click me"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><button onClick="alert(&apos;clicked&apos;)">click me</button></blockquote><p>When writing JavaScript code by hand, js/jsq is more comfortable.</p><hr><p>Let's see a few examples how JavaScript code is generated for us.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(js/jsq
 (do
  (set! set_s (fn [new_value] (set! x new_value)))
  (set! (.-member_a obj_1) (+ (.-member_b obj_2) u))
  (set! (aget arr_1 3) {:height 32, :width x})
  (console.log "done")
  (console.log :done)))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>set_s=function(new_value){x=new_value};obj_1.member_a=(obj_2.member_b+u);arr_1[3]={'height':32,'width':x};console.log('done');console.log('done')</blockquote><p>In the body of js/jsq we are in the JavaScript world. Everything including symbols that are unknown in Clojure are interpreted as JavaScript. There is no syntax or semantic check.</p><hr><p>Often we want to escape the JavaScript world and fill in Clojure Data. This can be done with the uq symbol.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let [msg "Hello World!"] (js/jsq (alert (uq msg))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>alert('Hello World!')</blockquote><p>This works for data, that can be directly introduced into the JavaScript code.</p><hr><p>Often we also want to introduce JavaScript code into other JavaScript code. Such JavaScript snippets cannot be created with js/jsq. The only purpose of js/jsq is to create strings for Hiccup. If we use it to introduce code into code, we would just get a JavaScript string inside the JavaScript code. We would
     have to call eval on it (which is also available in JavaScript). This is not something we normally want.</p><p>In order to directly introduce code into code we can use the macro js/q. That behaves in the same way as js/jsq and also has the uq mechanism to inject data. But unlike js/jsq the macro js/q does not render the code into a string.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [author
  "Sarah"
  msg
  (js/q (.toUpperCase (uq (str "Hello " author "!"))))]
 (js/jsq (alert (uq msg))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>alert('Hello Sarah!'.toUpperCase())</blockquote><hr><p>An alternative to this is to just quote the code that we want to introduce.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let [msg '(.toUpperCase "Hello You!")] (js/jsq (alert (uq msg))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>alert('Hello You!'.toUpperCase())</blockquote><p>However, that is not often practicable, because in this situation there is no unquote. So we cannot introduce data. The code can only ever be a constant.</p><hr><p>But sometimes we are in the situation that we already have JavaScript code as a s string and we want to introduce that into other JavaScript code. Normally js/jsq would place quotes around strings. We must prevent this if we want to introduce it as code. That can be done with jsi around uq.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [gen-msg "'Hello You!.toUpperCase()'"]
 (js/jsq (alert (jsi (uq gen-msg)))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>alert('Hello You!.toUpperCase()')</blockquote><p>Note that (uq (jsi (js/jsq ...))) has the same effect than (uq (js/q ...))</p><p>Note that uq and jsi are not Clojure symbols. They exist only in the JavaScript world and therefore are not namespaced.</p><hr><h2>Summary and Convention</h2><p>js/js is a function that takes a Clojure data structure, interprets it as JavaScript code and renders it into a string. As it is a function, it evaluetes it arguments first. Normally this fails if the code is not quoted.</p><p>js/q is a macro that takes a Clojure data structure and returns it without evaluating it. It is similar to the normal Clojure quote, but in addition has uq, which behaves similar to unquote in Clojure's syntax quote.</p><p>js/jsq is a macro that combines js/q with js/js, so that we can comfortably write JavaScript code with the Clojure Syntax, render it into a string and introduce it into Hiccup.</p><p>Many functions of HTMLKit take JavaScript code as a Clojure Data structure, which they introduce into the JavaScript code that they generate. The user when calling such functions in HTMLKit is responsible for preventing that the code is evaluated.</p><p>A few convenience macros take JavaScript code and automatically prevent it from beein evaluated. These convenience macros in their name end with 'q<-', indicating, that the arguments first are passed into the macro js/q, so that they are not evaluated.</p><p>Only a few functions of HTMLKit render JavaScript code into strings. This is the very last step, when the code is introduced into Hiccup. This is never appropriate when creating and working with JavaScript code. We always use the Clojure syntax. The high level functions of HTMLKit generate stings for us. But HTMLKit embraces HTML+JS. The user also wants to use JS directly withou the HTMLKit high level functions.</p><hr><p>We establish a naming for JavaScript instances.</p><p>'Unquoted JavaScript' are the arguments that are passed to js/q or js/jsq. Only macros can ever take unqoted JavaScript as arguments. Functions that take unquoted JavaScript are the most comfortable for the programmers. But unquoted JavaScript cannot exist at runtime. The reader consumes it by either rendering it into a string or by quoting it.</p><p>'Quoted' JavaScript are all data structures at runtime that represent JavaScript code in the Clojure syntax. There are no limitations when working with quoted JavaScript. Functions can be take quoted JavaScript. For the programmer it is not comfortable to write quoted JavaScript. Lists have to be manually created and the evaluation must be manually prevented. But when JavaScript is to be generated programmatically, this must be the preferred way.</p><p>'Rendered' JavaScript is the generated JavaScript code as a string, so that it can be integrated in Hiccup. This is always the very last step.</p><h2>Generating JavaScript</h2><p>We have now all ingredients to dynamically generate JavaScript code. All functions are easy to understand. But in practice it is more complicated than expected. </p><p>It is important to understand the difference between js/jsq and js/q. The macro js/q is very similar to quote in Clojure. It takes an expression and returns that expression without evaluating it. This is what we want when using the Clojure syntax for JavaScript. Normally we would just use quote. But quote has no unquote. In contrast js/q has unquote, which is is uq. This is the only reason why HTMLKit does not use just quote. Indeed js/q is a generic mechanism, that has nothing to do with the rest of the js namespace. It can be used as a spiced up version of quote. HTMLKit is responsible for preventing that the code is evaluated.<p></p>The macro js/jsq is just there for convenience. It is js/q plus an additional function call to js/js, which takes an expression and converts it into JavaScript.</p><p>When manually writing JavaScript code, the macro js/jsq is comfortable. But js/jsq has downsides. Clojure developers are often not aware that macros are very limited and should be avoided. They are not first class citicens in Clojure. They cannot be used in dynamic situations.</p><hr><p> Imagine you have a list of strings in Clojure and you want to create JavaScript that prints them all out. The obvious way to do this is the following.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [audience ["Peter" "Franc" "Joe"]]
 (js/jsq
  (do* (uq (map (fn [name] (js/q (console.log (uq name)))) audience)))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>console.log('Peter');console.log('Franc');console.log('Joe')</blockquote><hr><p>Now we don't want to use the constant strings, but JavaScript code for the audience.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [audience-code
  [(js/q (.getFullName db "Peter"))
   (js/q (.getFullName db "Franc"))
   (js/q (.getFullName db "Joe"))]]
 (js/jsq
  (do
   (console.log (uq (nth audience-code 0)))
   (console.log (uq (nth audience-code 1)))
   (console.log (uq (nth audience-code 2))))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>console.log(db.getFullName('Peter'));console.log(db.getFullName('Franc'));console.log(db.getFullName('Joe'))</blockquote><hr><p>But in some situations, that are not selden, the macros js/jsq or js/q for programmatically creating JavaScript code do not work. The following example is incorrect.</p><p>Define:</p><blockquote><pre>
(defmacro
 get-full-name<-q
 [name]
 (let
  [var-name 'fullname__31340__auto__]
  (list
   'quote
   (js/q
    (do
     (set! (uq var-name) (.getFullName db (uq name)))
     (console.log (uq var-name)))))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [audience
  ["Peter" "Franc" "Joe"]
  audience-code
  (map (fn [firstname] (get-full-name<-q firstname)) audience)]
 (js/jsq (do* (uq audience-code))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>fullname__31121__auto__=db.getFullName(firstname);console.log(fullname__31121__auto__);fullname__31121__auto__=db.getFullName(firstname);console.log(fullname__31121__auto__);fullname__31121__auto__=db.getFullName(firstname);console.log(fullname__31121__auto__)</blockquote><p>As can be seen there are numerous problems with this macro apart from not beeing easy to understand. The first problem is that the macro does not take the value for firstname. The second problem is that all variables, that are meant to be unique have the same name. With macros there is no workaround for these problems.</p><p>The same experiment with a function instead of a macro works as expected.</p><p>Define:</p><blockquote><pre>
(defn
 get-full-name
 [name]
 (let
  [var-name (gensym)]
  (js/q
   (do
    (set! (uq var-name) (.getFullName db (uq name)))
    (console.log (uq var-name))))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let
 [audience
  ["Peter" "Franc" "Joe"]
  audience-code
  (map (fn [firstname] (get-full-name firstname)) audience)]
 (js/jsq (do* (uq audience-code))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote>G__31423=db.getFullName('Peter');console.log(G__31423);G__31424=db.getFullName('Franc');console.log(G__31424);G__31425=db.getFullName('Joe');console.log(G__31425)</blockquote><h1>HTML Event Handling</h1><p>We have an HTML even thandling mechanism. First we have to load the event handling mechanism.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/load-event-handling)
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><script>actions=new Object();react=function(reaction,...args){reaction[1](document.getElementById(reaction[0]),...args)};fire=function(event,...args){actions[event].forEach(function(node){react(node,...args)})};othervalue=function(alternatives,current){if(alternatives[0]==current){return alternatives[1]}else{return alternatives[0]}}</script></blockquote><hr><p>Then we can register a new events.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/register-event "set-color")
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><script>actions['set-color']=[]</script></blockquote><p>These two functions yield only a very few lines of js.</p><hr><p>Now we can fire the event from js.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:button {:onclick (js/jsq (fire "set-color"))} "make green"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><button onclick="fire(&apos;set-color&apos;)">make green</button></blockquote><hr><p>The Macro js/jsq converts js code from a special Clojure syntax into a string, that can directly be used in Hiccup. But we don't have to write js by hand even if in the Clojure syntax. For firering events there is a function that can also be directly integrated into Hiccup.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:button {:onclick (hk/fire "set-color")} "make green"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><button onclick="fire(&apos;set-color&apos;)">make green</button></blockquote><p>In order to react on the event we have to create a node with an id.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
[:p
 {:id "red-node-1", :style {:color "red"}}
 "I start red and become green"]
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p id="red-node-1" style="color:red;">I start red and become green</p></blockquote><p>Then we can register a handler. This could be done by js. But that is complicated. The function regiser-handler yields the js code for us.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/register-handler
 "set-color"
 "red-node-1"
 (js/q (fn [node] (set! node.style.color "green"))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><script>actions['set-color'].push(['red-node-1',function(node){node.style.color='green'}])</script></blockquote><p>The id can also set with add-id. For manually written HTML code that is not so important. But for HTML code that is auto generated with auto-generated ids that simplifies the code.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/add-id
 "red-node-2"
 [:p {:style {:color "red"}} "I start red and become green"])
(hk/register-handler
 "set-color"
 "red-node-2"
 (js/q (fn [node] (set! node.style.color "green"))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p id="red-node-2" style="color:red;">I start red and become green</p><script>actions['set-color'].push(['red-node-2',function(node){node.style.color='green'}])</script></blockquote><p>This can be done all together. An id is automatically set.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/create-with-event-handler
 [:p {:style {:color "red"}} "I start red and become green"]
 ["set-color" (js/q (fn [node] (set! node.style.color "green")))])
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p id="G__31426" style="color:red;">I start red and become green</p><script>actions['set-color'].push(['G__31426',function(node){node.style.color='green'}])</script></blockquote><p>For simplification there is a macro for js part. Then we can use Clojure syntax for js.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
 [:p {:style {:color "red"}} "I start red and become green"]
 ("set-color" [node] (set! node.style.color "green")))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><p id="G__31427" style="color:red;">I start red and become green</p><script>actions['set-color'].push(['G__31427',function(node){node.style.color='green'}])</script></blockquote><p>This way of defining events is not practicable. Instead of hard coded strings for events, we want events automatically created. The internal JavaScript names of the events are not of enterest. Events should be used like normal variables in Clojure. There are comfortable let macros for that purpose. As Clojure is a functional programming language, a React like unidirectional data flow comes automatically.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/let-events
 [make-green make-blue]
 [:button {:onclick (hk/fire make-green)} "make green"]
 [:button {:onclick (hk/fire make-blue)} "make blue"]
 (hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
  [:p "I will be colored."]
  (make-green [node] (set! node.style.color "green"))
  (make-blue [node] (set! node.style.color "blue"))))
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><script>actions['make-green_31428']=[]</script><script>actions['make-blue_31429']=[]</script><button onclick="fire(&apos;make-green_31428&apos;)">make green</button><button onclick="fire(&apos;make-blue_31429&apos;)">make blue</button><p id="G__31430">I will be colored.</p><script>actions['make-green_31428'].push(['G__31430',function(node){node.style.color='green'}])</script><script>actions['make-blue_31429'].push(['G__31430',function(node){node.style.color='blue'}])</script></blockquote><hr><p>Quite often HTML and events are automatically created from data structures.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(let

  {:milk "white",
   :juice "yellow",
   :whine "red",

In order to add multiple dynamically created handlers, we would need the apply operator, which does not work for macros. The use case is very common. It can be achieved by not using the macro hk/create-with-event-handler<-q but the underlying function hk/create-with-event-handler.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>

But it is without technical detours exactly what we want. We created a list of beverages with colors and for each of them an event, which we pass down the DOM. Then for each event we create a button that fires it. Finally we create an HTML node that reacts on all these events with an event handler. That is an unidirectional top-down data-flow like React. But of course it is the responsibility of the user to establish the desired data flow. Events can freely passed around.</p><hr><p>HTML already knows many events, for example onload, clicked, onmouseover, onsubmit. It is so common to react on these events, that HTMLKit has a helper for this purpose. HTMLKit provides a convenience function for this.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/let-events
 [click hover seen]
 (hk/add-events
  [:button {:border 1} "click or hover me"]
  {:onClick click, :onMouseEnter hover, :onMouseLeave seen})
 (hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
  [:p "I will be colored."]
  (click [node] (set! node.style.color "green"))
  (hover [node] (set! node.style.color "blue"))
  (seen [node] (set! node.style.color "lightgrey"))))

(hk/let-events
 [paint-x-blue paint-y-blue]
 (hk/add-events
  [:button {:border 1} "click me"]
  {:onClick [paint-x-blue paint-y-blue]})
 [:p
  (hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
   [:span "X"]
   (paint-x-blue [node] (set! node.style.color "blue")))
  (hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
   [:span "Y"]
   (paint-y-blue [node] (set! node.style.color "blue")))])
</pre></blockquote><p>Result:</p><blockquote><script>actions['paint-x-blue_31446']=[]</script><script>actions['paint-y-blue_31447']=[]</script><button border="1" onClick="fire(&apos;paint-x-blue_31446&apos;);fire(&apos;paint-y-blue_31447&apos;)">click me</button><p><span id="G__31448">X</span><script>actions['paint-x-blue_31446'].push(['G__31448',function(node){node.style.color='blue'}])</script><span id="G__31449">Y</span><script>actions['paint-y-blue_31447'].push(['G__31449',function(node){node.style.color='blue'}])</script></p></blockquote><p>Events can also have arguments. The functions hk/fire, hk/add-events and hk/create-with-event-handler<-q support this. The arguments can come from the client or from the server. The following demonstrates all combinations.</p><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
(hk/let-events
 [click]
 (list
  [:p
   (hk/add-events [:button {:border 1} "click me"] {:onClick [click]})]
  (hk/create-with-event-handler<-q
   [:span
    "The color does not travel in the event. It is determined on the server."]

It is determined on the server.</span><script>actions['click_31450'].push(['G__31451',function(node){node.style.color='blue'}])</script></blockquote><p>Example:</p><blockquote><pre>
